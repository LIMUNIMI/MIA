## Abstract

This study focuses on the perception of music performances when
contextual factors, such as room acoustics and instrument, change. We
propose to distinguish the concept of “performance” from the one of
“interpretation”, which expresses the “artistic intention”. Towards
assessing this distinction, we carried out an experimental evaluation
where 91 subjects were invited to listen to various audio recordings
created by resynthesizing MIDI data obtained through Automatic Music
Transcription (AMT) systems and a sensorized acoustic piano. During the
resynthesis, we simulated different contexts and asked listeners to
evaluate how much the interpretation changes when the context changes.
Results show that: (1) MIDI format alone is not able to completely grasp
the artistic intention of a music performance; (2) usual objective
evaluation measures based on MIDI data present low correlations with the
average subjective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
measure which is meaningfully correlated with the outcome of the tests.
In addition, we investigate multimodal machine learning by providing a
new score-informed AMT method and propose an approximation algorithm for
the *p*-dispersion problem.
