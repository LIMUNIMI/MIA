## Abstract

This Thesis discusses the development of technologies for the automatic
resynthesis of music recordings using digital synthesizers. First, the
main issue is identified in the understanding of how Music Information
Processing (MIP) methods can take into consideration the influence of
the acoustical context on the music performance. For this, a novel
conceptual and mathematical framework named “Music Interpretation
Analysis” (MIA) is presented. In the proposed framework, a distinction
is made between the "performance" – the physical action of playing – and
the “interpretation” – the action that the performer wishes to achieve.
Second, the Thesis describes further works aiming at the democratization
of music production tools via automatic resynthesis: 1) it elaborates
software and file formats for historical music archiving and multimodal
machine-learning datasets; 2) it explores and extends MIP technologies;
3) it presents the mathematical foundations of the MIA framework and
shows preliminary evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach.
