## Abstract

  In this paper, a novel mathematical and conceptual framework for Automatic Music
  Transcription (AMT) is proposed with the purpose of integrating acoustical context
  factors in the analysis of the audio signal. The proposed framework is specifically
  designed to resynthesize the output of AMT models without affecting the artistic
  content of the performance. First, a mathematical formalization describing acoustics-
  specific transcription and resynthesis is proposed. Then, a methodological approach
  for the analysis of music performances while considering the contextual acoustical
  factors is shown.
  To prove that the acoustical context can be used to reduce the analysis error, we
  propose a novel score-informed AMT method able to predict note velocities and
  pedaling levels. We test different approaches to integrate the acoustical context
  information in the AMT process and show that the proposed methodology generally
  outperforms the usual AMT pipeline which does not consider specificities of the
  instrument and of the acoustic environment. Overall, the proposed mathematical
  formalization is shown to be a promising approach to tackle realistic automated music
  resynthesis.
